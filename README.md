#eInstall
##About
eInstall is a set of resources I commonly use in order to install easily all the plugins I need in a new Eclipse instance. It's composed of an Eclipse b3 script, which allows to generate a p2 repository that contains everything I need, and also a p2 repository in order to install everything easily.
